# Fluent i18n Community Guidelines

## TL;DR

Be cool, be helpful, don't be a jerk.

## The Spirit of the Thing

We're building a library that makes internationalization less painful. That means we want a community where:

- **Developers can write code in their native language**
- **Translators can work with familiar tools**
- **Everyone can contribute**

## What We're About

### ✅ Cool Stuff We Like
- **Helping each other out** - Got a question? Ask it. Know the answer? Share it.
- **Constructive feedback** - "This could be better because..." is way more useful than "This sucks"
- **Learning from mistakes** - We all mess up. Own it, fix it, move on.
- **Building something awesome** - Let's make i18n not suck the soul out of you for once

### ❌ Stuff That's Not Cool
- **Being a jerk** - Personal attacks, trolling, harassment? Not here.
- **Gatekeeping** - "You're not a real developer if..." - Seriously, stop.
- **Spam and self-promotion** - We get it, you have a product. But this isn't the place.
- **Politics and drama** - Keep it about the code, not about whatever's trending on truth social.

## The Rules (The Fine Print)

### 1. Be Respectful
This should be obvious, but:
- **Don't harass people** - Online or offline
- **Don't discriminate** - Age, race, gender, experience level, whatever - we don't care, and neither should you
- **Don't be creepy** - Keep it professional

### 2. Keep It On Topic
We're here to talk about:
- Fluent i18n library
- Java internationalization
- Translation workflows
- Code contributions
- Bug reports and feature requests

We're NOT here to discuss:
- Your political views
- Your conspiracy theories
- Your startup pitch
- Your personal drama

### 3. Quality Over Quantity
When contributing:
- **Test your code** - Don't submit broken stuff, its broken enough as it is
- **Write clear messages** - "Fixed the X bug" is better than "stuff"
- **Be patient** - We're all volunteers here

## Enforcement (The "What Happens If..." Part)

We're not trying to be the fun police, but sometimes people need a reality check.

## Dictatorship
We will not tolerate improper behaviour, and will swing the hammer as we see fit.

## Reporting Issues

If someone's being a jerk:
1. **Don't engage** - Don't feed the trolls
2. **Document it** - Screenshots, links, whatever
3. **Report it** - Use GitHub issues or contact the maintainers
4. **Move on** - We'll handle it, sometime, in the future

We take reports kinda seriously and investigate at a point in time. We also respect your privacy - we won't share your name unless you want us to.


## Questions?

If you're not sure about something:
- **Ask first** - Better to ask than assume
- **Check the docs** - We have some
- **Be specific** - "This doesn't work" is less helpful than "I get this error when..."

## Contact

Got a problem? Want to report something? Need to talk to a human?

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and general chat
- **Maintainers**: For serious community issues

You might not get a response immediately, but we will probably respond.
